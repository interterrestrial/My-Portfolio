            <h1>Who am I?</h1>

            <p> 
                I am Deepak Mishra, a student of Newton School of Technology, Rishihood University currently persuing my B.Tech in CS & AI. 
                <br> <br>
                I am an aspiring Game Developer with a passion for Game Design, 3D Modelling, Animation, and UI/UX design. With hands-on experience in Unreal Engine 4 for game development, Blender for 3D Modelling, and Figma for UI/UX, I am focused on honing my skills in game development and digital creation. I have a solid foundation in HTML and CSS for front-end development and have also explored Unity 3D as an alternative game engine. 
                <br> <br>
                As the President of the Game Development & Animation Club at my university, I lead a team of aspiring developers and designers, fostering collaboration, creativity, and learning within the community. I possess strong Leadership qualities and am skilled in Team Management, Team Building, and Communication, with excellent Presentation Skills that help me effectively share ideas and solutions.
                <br> <br>
                I have contributed as a 3D Artist & Game Developer in the development of a VR Game Project with my team, where I focus on creating high-quality 3D assets and immersive environments along with the Game Designing & Development. My goal is to continue growing as a Game Developer, specialising in Game Mechanics, 3D Design, and Animation, while continuously learning new tools and techniques to stay at the forefront of the gaming industry.
